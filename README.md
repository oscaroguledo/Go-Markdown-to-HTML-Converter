# Go-Markdown-to-HTML-Converter
A simple command-line tool built in Go that reads a Markdown (.md) file, converts its basic syntax (headers, bold, italic, lists, code blocks) into HTML, and outputs a well-structured HTML document.

go run main.go -in README.md -out index.html -title "My Doc"
go run main.go -in TEST.md -out output.html -title "My Doc" -serve
